# Action mechanism
Trigger (by script) in arma are very useful but contain a lot of code to do something. 
We need to create new paradigm to replace it and to enhanced the behavior. We need an 
action mechanism. An action is to execute something when the condition is true. In 
more we can specify if the action is a one shot or in a loop. Maybe you want that the 
action is timed also. By creating a registry of action we can start and stop an action.
